DbExcel - Query a database and generate an Excel sheet
===

The finished program is [jsonquery2xl.py](jsonquery2xl.py), with the others being slightly different attempts. [dbs.json](dbs.json) is a sample query file.

The program will execute all queries, and will create an excel spreadsheet with the results, with different sheets, as specified in the json file.
